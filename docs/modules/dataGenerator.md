# Generator Overview

The generator is responsible for generating data. The processor will call all the generators in a loop until each generator has returned a value. Should the generator directly manipulate the testcaseData object, it must nevertheless return a dummy value.

## Generator Lifecycle

![Generator Lifecycle](/img/data-generator/lifeCycle.svg)

The image shows the abstract lifecycle of a generator. When the processor starts up, it gets all the generators registered in the registry and calls the 'loadStore' function. Now, every generator is ready to be used.

> **Note**
> 
> Although not all the generators use a store, the function is called for each generator.

The processor then starts the executing the test cases. All test cases are independent from each other.
The processor loops over all the test cases. Then it will call the 'generate' method for all the generators until each generator has returned a value. Some generators may need data that has been previously created by another generator. If the generator is not able to generate data by the first call, the generator must return 'undefined'. Then it will be called again.

If the 'generate' method has returned data, then the 'createPostProcessTodos' method will be called.
The generator now has the possibility to return an array of todos. For each returned todo, the processor will call the 'postProcess' method. The idea behind having post processing is that sometimes it is not possible to create data until all the generators have created the data. However, it's not easy for the processor to find out if all the other generators have been executed. A postProcessTodo has also an order property. All the todos of all the generators are sorted by this order number. Then all the todos are executed in this order.

After the processor has finished executing all the test cases, the 'saveStore' function is called.

## InstanceId

The idea behind the 'instanceId' is to create an ID for each instance of generated data. So if the generator is called twice with the same instanceId it will return the same data. The instanceId is created by the processor for each test case.

  - Example  
    Let's say we have a test case where the generator should create a password, but the password needs to be entered in two separete fields - 'Password' and 'Password repeat'. This is common each time a user needs to reset the password. Thus, in the equivalence class table the generator is called twice with the same instanceId. Then the generator should return the same data. This is explained in more detail  the tutorial.

## Post processing

Although post processing is an exceptional case for a generator, it is sometimes very useful. Post processing directly operates on the 'testcaseData' object. It will not return any data.

To make the processor call the 'postProcess' function, the generator must have returned one or more
of these 'postProcessTodo' objects beforehand.

**post process todo object.**

``` js
{
  instanceIdSuffix: undefined   
  order: 1000                   
  config: {}                    
  generatorName: 'MyGenerator', 
}
```

  - (optional) The instanceId suffix. if not given, the current instanceId is used

  - (optional) The order number. Default is '1000'. All the todos are executed in the order of this number.
    So itâ€™s up to the author of the generator to define the right order.

  - (optional) The configuration for the function 'postProcess'.

  - (mandatory) The name of the generator to be called. So it's possible that one generator creates
    a postProcessTodo for another generator.

| serviceRegistry | The service registry. Each generator is added to the Service registry and each generator has access to this registry. So one generator could call another generator.                                             |
| unique          | {true/false} (default=true) If set to a true value, the data generator should return unique values. What unique means depends on the generator. If the generator create more than one field is up to the generator. |
| maxUniqueTries  | {number} (default=100) Defines how many attempts the generator will makedo for getting a unique value until it throws an error                                                                                           |
| varDir          | The directory used to store the generated data.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| useStore        | {true/false} (default=false) Should the generator persists the data.                                                                                                                                              |

additional properties

# Generator Interface

  - async loadStore()  
    (Not implemented) This function should load the store of the generator.

  - async saveStore()  
    (Not implemented) This function should save the store of the generator.

  - getGenerator(generatorName)  
    (Implemented)
    Returns the generator with the given name. If the generator does not exists, it throws
    an exception.

  - clearContext()  
    (Implemented)
    Clears the 'uniqueSet' and the 'instanceData' property.

  - async generate(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)  
    (Not implemented) This is the method normally used to do all the work. Here is where the data is generated.

  - async createPostProcessTodos(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)  
    (Not implemented) Only needed if the generator should do post processing.
    Sometimes, the generator is not supposed to create the data directly, or is supposed to do additional work later on.

  - async postProcess(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)  
    (Not implemented) Executes the post process.

# Generator Base

The base implementation of the interface in 'DataGeneratorBase.js' adds the load and
save store function. It Also handles the use of the instanceId.

It adds a new function '\_doGenerate()' which needs to be overwritten.
